SIFTvsSURF
==========

Comparison of SIFT and SURF on various image transformations

This code evaluates the SIFT and SURF algorithm against the following image transformations 

1) Rigid Body Transform

2) Similarity Transform

3) Affine Transform

4) Perspective Transform

!!Warning!!
The code takes approximately 8 hours to completely generate the results on the machine with following configuration

Processor: i3

RAM: 4GB

GPU: 1GB

@ToDO
Optimize the code by applying threading and cascading.
